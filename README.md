# CPPDS-OOPS-class
## Abstract
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines their structure (attributes) and behavior (methods) and promotes code organization, reuse, and abstraction. Objects are instances of a class.
Certainly, here's a slightly longer but still concise explanation:

**Constructor**:
- Initializes objects when created.
- Can be overloaded with different argument sets.
- Called automatically upon object creation.

**Destructor**:
- Cleans up resources when objects go out of scope.
- Called automatically upon object destruction.
- Typically used for releasing memory and performing cleanup.
In this reprositary, codes demonstrating class and constructor/deconstrutor.

## File 1

CODE 1:
In this we demonstrate functioning and creation of class. By taking an example of findign the volume of a cube.

## Algorithm:

1. Define a class "cube" with default dimensions.
2. Inside the class, create a method to calculate the volume.
3. Inside the class, create a method to display the volume.
4. In the main program, create an instance of the "cube" class.
5. Calculate the volume and display it.

CODE 2:
In this we display date using class.

## Algorithm:
1. Create a class that represents a date with three integer attributes.
2. Implement a method to check if the year is a leap year and return a boolean result.
3. Implement a method to display the day part of the date.
4. Implement a method to display the month as a string using an array of month names.

In this, we demonstrate the use and implementation of constructor and deconstructor.
